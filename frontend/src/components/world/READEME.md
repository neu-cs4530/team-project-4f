# Covey.Town Mini-map Extension

This extension was completed by Group 4F during the spring semester of the Spring 2022 Software Engineering class at Northeastern University.

## Deploying Feature

To utalize this feature, start the application as described in the root level README in the repository. 

## Using the Feature
When starting the application and connecting to the world, the user will see a new button on the top right of the Map view. The 'Toggle Map' tan button, when pressed, will toggle a map of the whole map to cover the screen and blur the Map object. 

From here, the user can look at the map and view teleportation locations that have been created. (If there are no fast travel locations a map with no locations can be easily adjusted by removing the fast travel constants at the top of the MinMap file.

Hitting the toggle map button again will return the user to the traditional game view.
